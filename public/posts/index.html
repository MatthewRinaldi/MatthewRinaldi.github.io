    <p><em>This post is for educational purposes only.</em></p>
<p>A few months ago I purchased Battlebit Remastered, which is a &ldquo;massive multiplayer FPS.&rdquo; The game is has provided me with a lot of enjoyment, but I have one gripe: there is no minimap. Pressing the &lsquo;M&rsquo; key does provide a map but it is not exactly mini: it fills up half your screen and makes it virtually impossible to play while activated. I thought it would be a fun project to try and make my own fully passive minimap: no hooks or inspecting process memory. Just pure packet sniffing. I also challenged myself to not disassemble and reverse the game&rsquo;s binary, which is why all my findings are closer to educated guesses rather than absolute truths.</p>
