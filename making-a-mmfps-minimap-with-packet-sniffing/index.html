<p>A few months ago I purchased REDACTED, which is a &ldquo;massive multiplayer FPS.&rdquo; The game is has provided me with a lot of enjoyment, but I have one gripe: there is no minimap. Pressing the &lsquo;M&rsquo; key does provide a map but it is not exactly mini: it fills up half your screen and makes it virtually impossible to play while activated. I thought it would be a fun project to try and make my own fully passive minimap: no hooks or inspecting process memory. Just pure packet sniffing. I also challenged myself to not disassemble and reverse the game&rsquo;s binary, which is why all my findings are closer to educated guesses rather than absolute truths.</p>

<h2 id="reversing-the-packet-format">Reversing the Packet Format</h2>
<p>The first step was to see what kind of traffic the game generated while playing in a multiplayer server. I used Wireshark to capture and analyze the packets. The game data was sent over UDP and was completely unencrypted, which made my life a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>I discovered that each UDP packet contains chunks of data in a TLV-esque format (more like LTV). There were several different kinds of packet types, but one type stood out in particular. Below is an example of a packet that contains players&rsquo; location:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>0000   02 00 00 29 00 0b 38 01 00 12 28 b6 c3 49 47 69   ...)..8...(..IGi

0070   ae 8d 62 3e 03 68 12                              ..b&gt;.h.
</code></pre><p>Figuring out the format of these packets took a bit of work and intuition. I found the coordinate data quite easily: there are three adjacent floats in the chunk, corresponding to x, y, and z coordinates. To get the full &ldquo;VSAT&rdquo; effect, I needed the heading of each player too, which was a bit trickier to find. I tediously stared at the hex digits of the chunks while facing my character in different directions, attempting to recognize any sort of pattern. Eventually, I figured out that the heading was encoded as a fractional 16-bit integer (i.e. number / 0xffff). The annotated packet below shows some of the fields I was able to decode. The player location packets sent from the client were in a similar format with some very minor differences.</p>

<p>To process the packets in real time, I made a Python script that utilized the scapy library&rsquo;s <code>sniff()</code> function. Combined with some basic struct <code>unpack()</code>&rsquo;s, I decoded all the data I needed to generate the minimap. I ran into an issue of my computer freezing after sniffing for an extended amount of time and after some googling, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31263464">found out why</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># without store=0, sniff will gradually gobble up all memory :/</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="rendering">Rendering</h2>
<p>With all the coordinate data extracted from the network, the next step was to display the data in a minimap-like format. I had initially planned to use the curses library, but ended up switching to WebGL, which I was a bit more familiar with. I used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSocket API</a> to transfer the data from Python to JavaScript. The WebGL code is straightforward, it rerenders new positions each time it receives a WebSocket messages.</p>
<p>I built a simple user interface to control some parameters of how the minimap was rendered. I could control:</p>
<ul>
<li>zoom level</li>
<li>centering the minimap on the player vs the center of the map</li>
<li>toggling heading (triangles vs dots)</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are some clips of the minimap in-game. The first is the full map view, and second is focused on my characters position.</p>

<p>You can see the teams moving from their spawns to different parts of the map and my character spawning in the last few seconds.</p>

<p>Building a player centric map forced me to relearn basic trignometry.</p>
<p>There are a few minor usability issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the triangles&rsquo; movement is not very smooth</li>
<li>there is no background showing buildings/obstacles on the map, which makes it difficult to judge distance</li>
<li>the minimap needs to be flushed often because there is an issue with stale packets being in the queue</li>
<li>there is a &lsquo;shadow&rsquo; following my character&rsquo;s position</li>
<li>and last but not least, I could not figure out was how to determine the corresponding team of a position packet, therefore all packets that come from the server (including my teammates) are shown in red.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure that with additional time and effort, I could sort all these issues out. But I was planning on making a proof of concept, and the concept was proofed enough for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It turns out you can still go pretty far just sniffing packets. I have omitted the game&rsquo;s name from this post because, although I believe this project is <em>technically</em> not breaking the EULA, I don&rsquo;t want to test that assumption.</p>
<p>Getting banned for looking at battles in bits seems like a bad time ;)</p>
